-- OBS! Created Human as abstract class rather than interface because requirement was to sort the collection of persons registered in the connection by age, and since entities 'Student' and 'Profesor' share a lot of fields, including age, they need to extend the abstract class Human which implements the Comparable\<T\> interface for comparing entities by age, that way polymorphism is preserved and each thread will have a single collection List\<Human\> that is going to be sorted. If 'Human' was interface, both Student and Profesor would implement it but one will not be able to compare a Student to a Profesor by age when sorting the collection in the thread, leading to creation of two collections for 'Student' and 'Profesor', losing the polymorphic behaviour. :D
